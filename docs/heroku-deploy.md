## One Click Deploy
When you're ready to share your app with the world, you can deploy your app to Heroku. 

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/QuantiModo/quantimodo-android-chrome-ios-web-app/)

After creating your Heroku app with the above button, go to the "Deploy" section for your app in the Heroku dashboard.
There, you can link the Heroku app to your Github repository.  Then, it will automatically update when you push changes
to Github.

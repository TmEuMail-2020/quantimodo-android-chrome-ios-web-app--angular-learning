ng-inspector is a browser extension that displays an inspector panel showing the AngularJS scope hierarchy in the current page in real time, as well as which controllers or directives are associated with which scope.

Hovering over a scope in the inspector will highlight the DOM element that scope is attached to. Clicking on a model will console.log that model's contents.

The extension adds a button next to the address bar with the Angular logo that toggles the pane on and off.

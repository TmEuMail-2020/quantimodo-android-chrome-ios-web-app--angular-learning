### Building Chrome App

For oAuth authentication, here are the three steps you need to complete:
* Specify the redirection URL in this format https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/<anything-here> For example, if 
your app ID is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef and you want provider_cb to be the path, to distinguish it with redirect 
URIs from other providers, you should use: https://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef.chromiumapp.org/provider_cb

* For uploading the app for the Chrome Web Store you first need to have an active Chrome app developer account, 
that you can create here `https://Chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard/`
* Once you have an active developer account, go to your developer account dashboard and click on add a new item.
* Copy the `www` folder from the project directory to /ChromeApps/{{appname}} directory, create its zip archive and 
upload it to the developer dashboard.
* Fill the details of the app and hit publish button.

### Automated Chrome Web Store Upload

publish it once manually and copy its app id in gulpfile.js like this
